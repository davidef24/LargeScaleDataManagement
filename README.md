This project intends to cover both the two parts of the Large Scale Data Management course, namely Information Integration and Big Data Management. All the following work is centered about the football domain, where I intended to gather data from different sources about players, clubs, matches and some relevant events that happen in a football match and integrate everything in a unified database where we can run insightful queries. More details in the "LSDM project.pdf" file.
